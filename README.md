# DormsManagement

### About
DormsManagement is a Java-based application designed for managing dormitories. It utilizes Swing for the user interface and a RESTful API for backend services. The project is intended to simplify dorm management by allowing administrators to manage rooms, tenants, and other dorm-related details through an intuitive graphical interface and REST endpoints.

### Features
- Swing-based GUI: A user-friendly graphical interface built with Java Swing to manage dormitory operations.
- RESTful API: Provides endpoints for interacting with dorm data, making it easy to integrate with other systems or automate tasks.
- Room and Tenant Management: Add, update, or remove rooms and tenants within the dormitory.
- Data Persistence: Supports saving data using a REST-based backend.
- Extensible Design: Easily extendable to add more features like reporting, billing, or occupancy analytics.

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or later: The project is developed in Java and requires a Java Development Kit (JDK).
- Apache Tomcat or any servlet container: To run the RESTful services.
- Eclipse IDE: Recommended for development and debugging, but any IDE supporting Java will work.
- Maven/Ant: For building the project (Ant build file build.xml is provided).

### Testing
You can find detailed instructions on how to test the application, including running unit tests and using the RESTful services, in the Testing.md file.
